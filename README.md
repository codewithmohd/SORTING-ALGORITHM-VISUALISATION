# SORTING-ALGORITHM-VISUALISATION
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the working of fundamental sorting and searching algorithms through clear and interactive visual animations. Instead of using backend technologies, this project focuses entirely on the algorithmic logic, helping students understand how data structures behave step-by-step during execution.
